# GRSH Plastics Project

A repository to share ideas about microplastics in seabirds, a reserach project led by [Anna Robuck](https://web.uri.edu/gso/meet/anna-r-robuck/) at URI with funding provided by the [National Seabird Program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/bycatch/seabirds).

Click [here](https://jmhatch.github.io/GRSH-Plastics-Project/) for an example data product of rescaled log10 counts (# / km2) of marine plastics provided by folks at the [OHI](https://github.com/ohi-science), as described in [Eriksen et al. (2014)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111913). Superimposed are several NOAA Fisheries Statistical Reporting Areas.
